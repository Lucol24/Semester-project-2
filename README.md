## 📜 **Key Components**  

### **📊 Data Files**  

- **`heat_demand.csv`** – Stores heating demand data for analysis.  
- **`production_units.json`** – Contains details about production units, such as energy production, consumption, and costs.  

### 🔧 Source Files  

- **`AssetManager.cs`** – Manages and loads static system data, including production units and heat demand from JSON and CSV files.  
- **`ProductionUnit.cs`** – Defines the `ProductionUnit` class, which stores data about energy production units, including max heat, electricity, costs, and emissions.  
- **`HeatDemand.cs`** – Defines the `HeatDemand` class, which stores winter and summer heat demand records.  
- **`Program.cs`** – Main application logic and execution flow.
